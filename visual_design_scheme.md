# Trellix ePO SSL Certificate Guide Visual Design Scheme

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

A precise, structured, and modern visual direction. The aesthetic draws inspiration from the clean, informational design of MIT Technology Review and the principles of Swiss Internationalism, emphasizing clarity and order. This system is designed to present complex technical information with authority and elegance, ensuring the content is the primary focus.

### Content Density

High density. This presentation is a detailed technical guide with step-by-step instructions and command-line examples. Each slide will contain 3-5 key points, prioritizing information clarity. Visuals will serve to support the technical content, with a text and code block occupancy of over 80% to ensure all critical details are effectively communicated.

## 2. Color System

**Primary Colors**

- Background color: #FFFFFF (white - clean, professional base)
- Primary color: #0150c5 (blue - trust, technology, security)
- Secondary color: #000000 (black - strong contrast for text)
- Accent color: #0150c5 (blue - for emphasis and highlights)

**Text Colors**

- Dark text (for light backgrounds): #1a1a1a (near-black for optimal readability)
- Light text (for dark backgrounds): #FFFFFF (white)

## 3. Font Design

**Heading Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Chiron Hei HK (modern geometric sans-serif with sharp lines, providing a strong technological feel - for main titles)
  - Hedvig Letters Sans (distinctive sans-serif with unique character, adding brand personality - for section headers)

**Body Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Quattrocento Sans (classic and highly readable sans-serif, ensuring clarity for technical text - primary body text)
  - Coda (friendly and open sans-serif, offering a slightly softer tone for explanations - secondary body text)

## 4. Image Style

Imagery should be abstract and conceptual, focusing on minimalist data visualizations, network diagrams, and architectural schematics. Use clean vector graphics with thin lines in the primary blue color. Avoid photography; instead, use stylized code snippets and command-line interfaces. The style should be precise and functional, reinforcing the structured nature of the technical content.
